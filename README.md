# **Hobbies and Interests**

I have a strong passion for discovering and exploring open-source software, especially tools that enhance productivity, automation, and security. In my free time, I build and maintain home lab environments to experiment with systems architecture, deployment strategies, and infrastructure optimization. I'm also deeply interested in emerging technologies, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, and enjoy learning how AI can be applied to solve real-world problems and streamline IT operations.
